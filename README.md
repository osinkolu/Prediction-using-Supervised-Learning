# Prediction using Supervised Learning
In this video, I have presented a code for predicting the percentage of an student based on the number of study hours. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
We will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions. We will start with simple linear regression involving two variables.
